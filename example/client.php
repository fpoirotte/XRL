/*
 * This example expects an XML-RPC server providing a "qux"
 * procedure (such as the one in "server.php"). The server
 * should be served from a file called "server.php" in the
 * same folder as this script on this machine's webserver.
 *
 * This script will automatically generate the URL required
 * to query the XML-RPC server by substituting this script's
 * filename with "server.php". For example:
 *
 * Client: http://localhost/xmlrpc/client.php
 * Server: http://localhost/xmlrpc/server.php
 *
 * Client: https://foobar.example.com:4443/tests/xrl/client.php/foo.bar?baz=1
 * Server: https://foobar.example.com:4443/tests/xrl/server.php
