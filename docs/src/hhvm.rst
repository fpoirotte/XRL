HipHop Virtual Machine
=======================

    HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) is a process virtual machine
    based on just-in-time (JIT) compilation, serving as
    an execution engine for PHP and Hack programming languages.

XRL should be compatible with HHVM. To ensure that, we actively test against HHVM
in our `Continuous Integration process <https://travis-ci.org/fpoirotte/XRL>`_.
