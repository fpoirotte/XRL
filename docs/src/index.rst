Welcome to XRL's documentation!
===============================

XRL (short for XML-RPC Library) is a collection of PHP classes aiming at easing
the creation of XML-RPC clients or servers.
The API is meant to be very intuitive and yet very extensible in case you ever
need to customize parts of the code.
