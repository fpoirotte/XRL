A simple XML-RPC client and server written in PHP
=================================================

Features
--------

XRL provides the following features:

*   Simple servers, using the property operator ``->`` to indicate
    what methods the server provides.

*   Simple clients, using the regular method call syntax
    ``$client->procedure(42)`` to call a procedure
    provided by the remote XML-RPC server.

*   Intuitive XML-RPC calls, with automatic type conversion between
    PHP types and their XML-RPC counterparts.

*   Extensibility, using the array operator ``[]`` to manipulate
    the factories used by either the client or server.

*   Optional validation of XML-RPC messages (both requests and responses).

*   Two XML output formats (compact or indented), making it easy
    to debug potential issues.

*   Many different types of installations are possible
    (sorted from easiest to most complex):

    -   Using a PHAR archive.
    -   Using a git clone.
    -   From sources.

*   A CLI script (for git/source installs, but see below)
    that can be used to query a remote XML-RPC server,
    display traffic (for debugging purposes), etc.

*   A ``.phar`` archive that contains all of XRL's source code
    and can also be used in place of the regular CLI script.

*   Compatibility with PHP versions from PHP 5.2.1 onward.


Installation
------------

Several types of installations are possible:

*   Using a ``.phar`` archive:

        $ wget --no-check-certificate https://pear.erebot.net/get/XRL-dev-master.phar

*   From a git clone:

        $ git clone git://github.com/fpoirotte/XRL.git

*   From sources:

    -   As a `.tar.gz archive <https://github.com/fpoirotte/XRL/tarball/master>`_:

            $ wget -O XRL-sources.tar.gz https://github.com/fpoirotte/XRL/tarball/master

    -   As a `.zip archive <https://github.com/fpoirotte/XRL/zipball/master>`_:

            $ wget -O XRL-sources.zip https://github.com/fpoirotte/XRL/zipball/master
