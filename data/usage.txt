Usage: %1$s [options] <server URL> <procedure> [args...]

Options:
 -h               Show this program's help.
 -n               Dry run. Don't send the actual query.
                  Use with -d to debug encoder issues.
 -t <timezone>    Use this timezone to convert dates between local
                  and remote time. Eg. "Europe/Paris".
 -v               Be verbose (repeat for even more verbose output).
                  Requires erebot/plop.
 -V               Show this program's version and exit.
 -x               Perform XML validation on received messages.

Additional parameters for the procedure must be passed as a list
of types & values, where the following types may be used:
bool      The next argument is a boolean.
          Use "0", "off" or "false" for false
          and "1", "on" or "true" for true.
datetime  The next argument is a date with time information,
          using one of PHP's compound formats.
          Eg. "@1215282385" for a UNIX timestamp.
          See also http://php.net/datetime.formats.compound.php
file      Same as "string" but the next argument is a filename
          whose content should be used (useful for binary data).
float     The next argument is a floating-point number.
hash      Read all arguments until a matching "endhash" is found,
          then build a hash from the types & values in between.
          Nested constructs are supported.
          Eg. "hash int 42 hash int 23 float 3.14 endhash endhash"
              = array(42 => array(23 => 3.14))
int       The next argument is a 32 bits signed integer.
list      Read all arguments until a matching "endlist" is found,
          then build a list from the types & values in between.
          Nested constructs are supported.
          Eg. "list list int 42 endlist int 23 endlist"
              = array(array(42), 23)
null      Add NULL to the current list of arguments.
          This type does not require any additional argument.
string    The next argument is a string (possibly containing
          binary data).

Example:
  %1$s %2$s foo int 42 bool on

  is roughly equivalent to:

  <php
    require_once('path/to/XRL/Autoload.php');
    \fpoirotte\XRL\Autoload::register();
    $client = new \fpoirotte\XRL\Client("%2$s");
    var_dump($client->foo(42, true));
  ?>
